# Optimization of an evacuation exit
## Introduction
The idea behind this project was to consider a rectangular room in a planar view and place polygonal obstacles within it. A crowd, represented by a cloud of points, is added to this room. The user is given the possibility to place exit doors in the room. An evacuation is then initiated, and the time required to evacuate the room is measured. The goal is to determine, for a given layout, the strategic locations to place the exit doors in order to optimize movement times.
